# Hotel Booking Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing hotel booking data to gain insights into customer behavior, booking trends, and key factors influencing hotel stays. The dataset includes information such as booking status, customer demographics, booking lead times, cancellation rates, special requests, and more. The goal of this analysis is to explore trends in booking patterns, cancellation behavior, and seasonality to provide actionable insights for decision-making in hotel management.

Through this analysis, we employ various data analytics techniques, including data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization. Python was used extensively for data processing, with libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for visualizing key trends. Key metrics like average daily rate, lead time, booking window, and cancellation rates are examined to identify potential areas of improvement in hotel operations. The insights derived from the analysis could be useful in optimizing revenue management, customer retention strategies, and improving overall hotel services.

This project is particularly useful for hotel management teams, data analysts, and anyone interested in learning more about the dynamics of the hotel industry.
